# Modern Design Tools

The tools we have for design are dangerously disconnected from their mediums. They cant work with real data. They cant work with real code. They cant be used to be create real things. How can we design when we cant see, touch, move, or work with our designs.

Design is more than pixels, design is an iterative, interactive, collaborative feedback cycle between designer and work. There are people thinking about solutions to this. There are companies and developers working on tools. There are apps you can use today.

This is a list of all the blog posts, people, experiments, tools, services, apps and plugins that are part of a new generation of design tools; modern design tools that put the designer back in touch with their work.
